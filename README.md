# Automating-an-electric-circuit-through-a-mobile-phone
The intention was to develop an IoT system that helps the user control the operation of electrical devices by a single text message sent in a predetermined format from the user end. Future scope of this system is tremendous, since it can be interfaced with several other appliances and devices also, without tampering the appliance

The respository contains the contains the code for the android app. The system needs an arduino (While I used arduino uno, nano or subsequent versions will also do), HC-05 Bluetooth module and a circuit. However the arduino code is quite simple to write as well, and only needs to detect whether the incoming input is High(1) or Low(0).
